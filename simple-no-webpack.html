        This is a simplified example where I include all the files of my application individually.
        It shows that the application is spawning and the WebWorker is also working.

        Open your developer tools, you should notice following output:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Hello Main Browser UI Thread! <em>Indicating the library being loaded within the browser thread</em></li>
        <li>Starting small demo library <em>Indicating the main application is starting</em></li>
        <li>Hello Web Worker! <em>Indicating the WebWorker spawned correctly.</em></li>
    </ol>
    <script type="module">
        import * as main from './src/simple.js'
    </script>
