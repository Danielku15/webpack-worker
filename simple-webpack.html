        This is a simplified example where I pack a small library into an own dedicated chunk.
        My plan is to give integrators of my library the advise to configure WebPack like the following snippet (plus
        whatever the discussion brings). This way it is ensured that my lib is within an own chunk/file which can be
        loaded
        within the WebWorker and it is not packed together with libs like bootstrap or Angular which will cause issues
        when started in the WebWorker.

        optimization: {
            splitChunks: {
                cacheGroups: {
                    mylib: {
                        minSize: 0,
                        chunks: 'all',
                        name: 'chunk-mylib',
                        priority: 10,
                        test: /.*mylib.*/,
                    },
                },
            },
        }
    </pre>

        Open your developer tools, you should notice following output:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Hello Main Browser UI Thread! <em>Indicating the library being loaded within the browser thread</em></li>
        <li>Starting small demo library <em>Indicating the main application is starting</em></li>
        <li>Detected unusable import.meta.url pointing to local file <em>Indicating the import.meta.url was rewritten to a local file URL (inspect the build output to look at it).</em></li>
        <li><span style="color: red">Hello Web Worker! never appears, but my errors are logged</span></li>
    </ol>
